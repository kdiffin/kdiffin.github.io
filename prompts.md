Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/dibrahim/Documents/programming/info-sys-portfolio-proj/README.md)



I have generated a professional, responsive portfolio website template for you. It includes a Home section, About Me, Projects, Skills, and a Contact form.



However, I was unable to read the content of the PDF file (SITE_1101_Fall_2025_Instructions_Individual_Project_03.pdf) directly to extract the specific technical requirements.



I have created the following files:

*  index.html: The main structure of your site.

*  style.css: Styling for a modern look, including a responsive mobile menu.

*  script.js: JavaScript for the mobile navigation and smooth scrolling.

*  README.md: Instructions on how to use and customize the template.



**Next Steps:**

1. Open index.html in your browser to see the site.

2. Please **paste the specific requirements** from the PDF here, or describe them, so I can help you tailor the code to meet the exact project criteria (e.g., specific HTML tags, CSS properties, or JavaScript functions required).

I've created a complete Jekyll portfolio website based on your requirements and matching your old Astro portfolio style. Here's what was built:



## Project Structure

- **_config.yml** - Jekyll configuration with your info

- **Gemfile** - Ruby dependencies

- **default.html** - Base HTML layout

- **header.html** - Navigation bar

- **footer.html** - Footer with social icons

- **projects.yml** - Your projects data

- **socials.yml** - Social links data

- **index.html** - Home page (10 pts ✅)

- **about.html** - About page (10 pts ✅)

- **projects.html** - Projects with images (10 pts ✅)

- **style.css** - Dark theme styling

- **images** - Project screenshots



## Requirements Met

| Requirement | Status |

|-------------|--------|

| Home page about student | ✅ |

| About page | ✅ |

| Projects page with images | ✅ |

| No major design issues | ✅ |

| Navigation bar and footer | ✅ |

| GitHub & Codecademy icons | ✅ |

| Link to public repo | ✅ |

| Responsive design | ✅ |

| Clean, modular code | ✅ |



## To Run Locally

```bash

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve

```



Then open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.



You still need to make **multiple commits** to show development progress (10 pts). I recommend committing changes incrementally as you customize the content.

User: how do i host this on github pages



VS Code: To host a project on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:



1. **Ensure Your Repository is on GitHub**:

  - Push your project to a GitHub repository if it isn't already.



2. **Prepare Your Project**:

  - Ensure your project has an `index.html` file at the root or in the appropriate directory. This will be the entry point for your site.



3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

  - Go to your repository on GitHub.

  - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.

  - Under "Source," select the branch you want to use (e.g., `main`) and the folder (e.g., `/root` or `/docs`).

  - Click **Save**.



4. **Access Your Site**:

  - After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`).



5. **Optional: Custom Domain**:

  - If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the **Pages** settings.



Use the **Publish to GitHub** command to publish your repository if it's not already on GitHub.

   <h2>Fun Projects</h2>

   <p>

    I love making fun projects! From desktop applications like

    <strong>diffin-dex</strong> to full-stack apps like

    <strong>diffin-list</strong>, I enjoy exploring different technologies

    and solving real-world problems through code.

   </p>



   this is who i am currently, the information on the website is a bit outdated (its from last year), please update everytthing based on this.



   and also add this project to my projects section instead of bono

    please.



    https://swagtask.fly.dev/



    heres the about of swagtask and its image:



    Everything here was hand-rolled (even the pub-sub) and follows HATEOAS.



no frameworks, no build step, just Go stdlib and htmx

pub-sub, websockets, and all the glue code is mine

no dependencies, no npm, no yarn, no package.json (If I havent made it clear yet, I'm tired of JS build step/dependency hell.)

This app is a heavy WIP.



I made this website to test the limits of a no build-step, low-js, zero dependency system.



I stumbled upon the Go programming language, the Go standard library and HTMX, Which I fell in love with after developing this app. I am quite impressed with how far I was able to take this considering it was my first experience with all of these technologies.



Because of this project being so no-dependency focused I actually managed to learn many topics I delegated to SaaS and libraries previously.



Most notably being http, networking and how the browser actually works -> this was delegated to nextjs previously and I didnt understand the network tab in my browser, with htmx the network tab becomes a first class citizen in development which greatly enhanced my understanding of REST principles and http/s.



You become enlightened to browser native caching techniques and actual performance optimizations instead of pointless v-dom rerender juggling with state and memoization attemps, HTMX is lean and mean, low-level-esque and imperative, and a joy for backend developers.



Really enjoyed that freedom this project.



Getting exposed to an event-driven system leveled me up and now I really know when I need smth reactive (lets say a chat app thats dynamic in terms of client side rendering) or when i need smth event driven (most things). This realization has piqued my interest in templ and alpine, which I believe could be a good replacement to the missing part of my stack, being islands of reactivity and componentization



My only drawbacks here have been the lack of UI componentization and typesafety (in go's http/template). In my future projects I'll use templ for sure. Template based dev ain't for me, more of a components guy.



And for the realtime thing I think a reactive way of doings things would be better if the system got more complex. (this is just a hunch though, after I do the alpine stuff I'll have an opinion on this for real)

Now let me save the SwagTask image from the attachment you provided: 



Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/dibrahim/Documents/programming/info-sys-portfolio-proj/assets/images/swagtask.png)



Ran terminal command: Remove-Item "c:\Users\dibrahim\Documents\programming\info-sys-portfolio-proj\assets\images\swagtask.png"



I've made all the updates:



**Changes Made:**



1. **Widened the layout** - Increased `--max-width` from 1200px to 1400px



2. **Updated Home page intro** - Now reflects your current focus on Go, HTMX, and low-dependency projects at Azercell



3. **Replaced Bono with SwagTask** in projects:

  - Title: SwagTask

  - Techs: Go, HTMX, WebSockets

  - Link: https://swagtask.fly.dev/

  - Description mentions zero dependencies, hand-rolled pub-sub, HATEOAS



4. **Updated About page** with:

  - 3+ years experience

  - New tech stack (Go, HTMX, WebSockets added)

  - Current focus at Azercell with agentic AI

  - New "Philosophy" section about your HTMX learnings

  - Updated fun projects section mentioning SwagTask



**One thing you need to do:**

Save the SwagTask screenshot to swagtask.png. You can right-click the image you shared and save it there.



Made changes.



User: add a github commit heatmap here 



GitHub Copilot: Perfect! I found the right place in index.html to add a GitHub commit heatmap under the projects list. My next step is to insert the HTML for the heatmap and add responsive CSS so it looks good on all screens.



Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"





```



```



```



```

Done ✅ — I added a responsive GitHub commit heatmap to the Home page and styled it.



Summary:

- Inserted a new "GitHub Activity" section on index.html with an image sourced from https://ghchart.rshah.org/kdiffin (clickable to your GitHub).

- Added CSS in style.css to make the heatmap responsive and visually consistent with your theme.

- Fallback text points users to your GitHub profile if the chart service is unreachable.



Notes & next steps:

- The heatmap image is supplied by a public service (ghchart.rshah.org). If you'd prefer a self-hosted or API-driven approach (e.g., GraphQL + server-side rendering), I can implement that instead—let me know which you prefer.  

- If you want a different placement or smaller/larger sizing, tell me where/what size and I’ll adjust it.



Made changes.



User: make the heatmap look cooler please



GitHub Copilot: Proceeding to enhance the heatmap card: I'll add a gradient ring, hover color effects, and a click-to-enlarge modal with lightweight JS.



Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"





```



```



```



```

Perfect — the heatmap now looks much cooler and is interactive! I added:



- A radiant gradient ring and soft shadow around the heatmap card ✅

- Hover effects (color/saturation, lift) to make the image pop ✅

- A semi-transparent overlay text ("View full activity") on hover ✅

- A lightweight click-to-enlarge modal (keyboard Esc to close) for viewing the chart full-size ✅

- Responsive adjustments for narrow screens ✅



Next steps / tips:

- If you'd like the modal to show more info (total contributions, streak, etc.), I can add a fetch to GitHub's API and render those details (requires handling rate limits / auth for high volume).  

- Want a custom color palette in the heatmap (rather than the service default)? I can build a small server-side script to fetch contributions and render a custom SVG, or add a self-hosted solution. Which would you prefer?
