# Portfolio Website

This is a template for a personal portfolio website.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for interactivity (mobile menu, smooth scrolling).

## Customization

1.  **Personal Information**: Open `index.html` and replace `[Your Name]`, `[Insert your bio here...]`, etc., with your actual information.
2.  **Projects**: Update the "Projects" section in `index.html` with your actual projects.
3.  **Images**: You can replace the background image in `style.css` (under `.hero`) with your own image.
4.  **Requirements**: Please refer to your `SITE_1101_Fall_2025_Instructions_Individual_Project_03.pdf` file for specific requirements that need to be implemented.

## Note

I was unable to read the content of the PDF file directly. Please review the PDF and update the content of this website to match the specific technical requirements listed there.
